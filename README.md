# Sudoku
_My first attempts at a Java-based App: A **Sudoku Puzzle Game**!!_

This is something I've been working on since I first started studying Programming a few months ago.

It started as a (failed) **sudoku-solving GUI-less program (v0.x)**, which soon after evolved into a **Swing-based project (v1.x)**. This project was then **switched to JavaFX, added a few features (v2.x)**, and is now **self-dependent** (no more .txt files containing the grids), **displays some new characteristics and a more stylish GUI (v3.x)**.

What's next:
- Improve game saving and loading.
- Improve sudoku-solving algorithm.
  - Add levels depending on the depth of the algorithm required to solve a particular puzzle.
- Add some GUI features such as:
  - "Crosshairs": slightly highlight column and row (and maybe block?) of the selected cell.
  - Possibility of pencil-writing at the edge of columns and rows.
- Show number suggestions for beginners.
- And basically anything else that anyone else can think of that could be relatively easy to implement and will improve user experience.
